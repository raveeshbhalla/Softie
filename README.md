# Softie (Deprecated)

We never ended up using the library within our app and I haven't had the opportunity to test it out thoroughly. As such, I'm deprecating the library. If you'd like to, please create a fork and take over development if it might be of use to you.

Softie is a library that aims to provide a callback to an Activity or a Fragment whenever the software keyboard is hidden or shown, as well as provide the height of the keyboard. This library is aimed primarily at messaging applications and other apps that use an EditText at the bottom of their layout, and might want to use the keyboard space, when it is not shown, to provide users with certain content.

An example of this can be seen with the Google Hangouts app and the Haptik Personal Assistant app.
